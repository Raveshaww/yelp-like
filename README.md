# Yelp-like project

The notes on this project will be fairly sparse, as this was from back in 2017. I'm mainly uploading it to GitHub for the purposes of notes and memories. I won't really be making much effort into things like updating packages.

# Notes
This website was made while following along with Colt Steele's "Web Development Bootcamp" on Udemy. It was meant to teach me how to use the following technologies and concepts:
* Node.js
* Express.js
* Passport.js
* MongoDB
* Mongoose
* EJS
* NPM
* RESTful Routing
* Authorization
* Authentication

Additionally, it provided pretty good practice in general with the following:
* Bootstrap
* JavaScript
* HTML5
* CSS3
* Linux command line (bash)
